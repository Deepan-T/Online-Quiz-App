The quiz questions primarily focus on the following Java fundamentals:

* Control Flow (Loops, `if-else` vs. `switch`)
* Collections Framework (`List`, `Map`, `ArrayList`)
* Utility Classes (`Scanner`, `Collections`)

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements

* **Java Development Kit (JDK):** Version 8 or higher.

üìù Code Structure
The application consists of two main classes:

Question
. This class is responsible for managing a single quiz question.

. Constructor: Initializes the question text, a list of options, and the index of the correct option.

. displayQuestion(): Prints the question and its numbered options to the console.

. checkAnswer(int answer): Compares the user's input with the correct option.

. getCorrectAnswer(): Returns the string value of the correct option.

QuizApp
. This class contains the main method and drives the entire quiz flow.

. Initialization: Creates a List of Question objects, populating the quiz with all the questions.

. Quiz Logic: Iterates through the questions, prompts the user for input using Scanner, checks the answer, and keeps track of the score and userAnswers.

Results: Prints the total score and then a detailed breakdown of the quiz session.
